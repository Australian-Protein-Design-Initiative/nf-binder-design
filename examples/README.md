# Example configurations

There are a number of example configurations for different workflows here (`main.nf` rfdiffusion design, `partial.nf` rfdiffusion partial diffusion, `bindcraft.nf` bindcraft design).

They are setup for quick test runs on a local GPU workstation (for real production runs you'll need many more trajectories). Most should finish in under and hour.
